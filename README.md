# Blockchain_Cryptocurrency
Blockchain and cryptocurrency (named RanCoin) implementation in python.
This is a simple implementation which does not hash user data (eg. private id) and only defines the genral architecture of Blockchains and the CryptoCurrency protocol. The server is built over Flask and the requests and posts are made over the web server.
